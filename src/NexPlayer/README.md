## Overview

The NexPlayer HTML5 Player is a fully customizable media player that enables HLS and MPEG-DASH streaming with broadcast quality video across all platforms, browsers, and devices. Premium OTT services can now provide an outstanding user experience thanks to a flexible feature set including the latest playback capabilities, advanced DRM content protection, and advertisements like client-side ad insertion (CSAI) with VPAID, VMAP, VAST, and server-side ad insertion (SSAI).
