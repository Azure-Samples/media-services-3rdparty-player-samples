DASH CMAF with AES-128 encryption.

ExoPlayer does not support DASH with AES-128 encryption yet. All the format supported can be found [here](https://exoplayer.dev/dash.html).

- There is an issue to know if there is any plan to add support to this: [here](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/7694).
